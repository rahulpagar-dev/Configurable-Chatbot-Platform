-   **Text & Voice Input:**
    * Send messages via text input.
    * Simulated voice input capability for an enhanced user experience.
-   **File Attachment Simulation:** Users can "attach" files (images, documents), which are then acknowledged by the dummy AI response.
-   **Mock Authentication Flow:**
    * A smooth, transparent backdrop Sign In popup appears on first visit.
    * Allows login with *any* mock email and password, demonstrating a client-side authentication state.
    * Dynamic header displaying logged-in user's name and a logout option.
-   **Dynamic Welcome Message:** A custom welcome message "The AI Platform for Independent Consultants and Professionals" is displayed upon successful login, transitioning smoothly into view.
-   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a consistent experience across various devices, from desktop to mobile.
-   **Thinking/Recording Indicators:** Visual feedback (spinners, pulsing mic) when the AI is processing or voice input is active.

    cd [your-repo-name]
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
